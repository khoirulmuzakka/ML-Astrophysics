# ML-Astrophysics
This repo contains all program I wrote as solutions to exercise sheets in the Machine Learning Course for Astrophysics at Ludwig-Maximilans Universit√§t Munchen. So far there are 5 exercise sheet. The first two exercise sheets are quite easy (just fill in the prepared notebook) so I do not upload them here.
